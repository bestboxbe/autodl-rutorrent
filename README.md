# autodl-rutorrent (Modernized Version)

[autodl-rutorrent](https://github.com/autodl-community/autodl-rutorrent) is a plugin for ruTorrent designed to monitor and configure [autodl-irssi](https://github.com/autodl-community/autodl-irssi).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This version has been significantly modernized and improved by **[bestbox.be](https://bestbox.be)** to ensure compatibility with modern ruTorrent releases (v5.2.10+ and newer), which often break legacy plugin layouts due to Bootstrap 5 and other framework updates.

## Major Improvements in this Fork

*   **Modern CSS Architecture:** Transitioned from legacy static CSS to a dynamic system using CSS variables, allowing the plugin to better match the main ruTorrent theme.
*   **Bootstrap 5 Compatibility:** Comprehensive layout fixes to resolve conflicts with modern ruTorrent's frontend frameworks.
*   **Flexbox Layout:** Rewritten UI components using Flexbox for better responsiveness and stability across different screen sizes.
*   **Bug Fixes:** Various fixes for UI glitches, button alignment issues, and text overflow problems in dialogs (Filters, Trackers, Preferences, etc.).

## Getting Started

*   **Installation:** Simply download or clone this repository into your ruTorrent `plugins` directory.
*   **Requirements:** Requires ruTorrent and a functional `autodl-irssi` setup.
